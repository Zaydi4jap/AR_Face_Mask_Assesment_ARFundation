# AR_Face_Mask_Assesment_ARFundation
Simple AR face mask using ARFundation (ARCore XR Plugin & ARKit Face Traking) which can track the orientation of the user's face and change the displayed face mask for Android in Unity 2019.

In this project I use ARFundation, which is a cross-platform framework that allows us to build augmented reality experiences once, then build for either Android or iOS devices where the features I use are ARCore XR Plugin and ARKit Face Traking.
Apart from that, I also added code to swap the mask by using the toggle button.
